Question to answer: Who will win the tournament?
		More specifically, use regular season data to determine tournament winner
		Caveat of this is that he just looks at one season
Used Kaggle dataset w/ Sports-Reference stats
115113 games played, 16 stats from each game, binary answer to "Did Team 1 win?"
	xTrain was 115113 x 16
	yTrain was 115113 x 1
Ran on different models
Tested each on different train/test splits, taking the average of the many tests to determine how accurate that model was

Notes on code

Most of code is data prep / cleaning

Feature Selection
	Model takes in two D dimensional vectors
	Features are averages over the regular season
		His question is just trying to predict tournament winners
			But he does it in a way that can apply a prediction to any two teams
			Not just tournament games
compareTwoTeams()
	For a given game, get the two team's invormation at that point, look at the differences, and 1 if Team 1 wins

Testing Models
	Scikit-Learn has the models just take in the feature set
