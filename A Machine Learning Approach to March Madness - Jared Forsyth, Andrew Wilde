A Machine Learning Approach to March Madness
Jared Forsyth, Andrew Wilde

Abstract

Only had to use 5 features to obtain a 73% prediction accuracy

----------------------------------

Introduction

Wanted to focus on improving predictions on individual games in isolation, not making the perfect bracket
	Predict the outcome between any two teams

----------------------------------

Data Source

ESPN.com and NCAA.com

ESPN provided 47 features per team for each game
Looked only at tournament games

----------------------------------

Selected Models

Only used continuous data
Only looked at team data, not player data

----------------------------------

Improvements

Some initial assumptions about the data
	The two teams' stats for a given game are functionally linked
		Attributes of Team 1 affect how Team 2 would have performed
	If you just focus on the winner, then you don't have information on when a team loses
		Knowing what contributes to losses is just as important as know what contributes to winning
	
Removed any ordering
	None of their algorithms used ordering effectively
	
Feature Reduction
	Used algorithms to detemrine the best features for desired test algorithms
	kNN ended up being their best prediction model after feature reduction (down to 5 to 10 features)
		Just focused on that moving forward

----------------------------------

Results

Used random ordering
Looked at the 4 feature reduction models to see their effects on lowering the features across the numerous models
	Random Forest Reduction worked best with kNN

----------------------------------

Conclusion

Style theory - different teams match-up better/worse vs different types of teams
	Quickness vs Height, Offensive vs Defensive, Talent vs Veterans, etc.
Some features are increase predictions for certain teams than others
	i.e. FT% might have more weight to teams that get more FT because they can convert more points
Recommended getting venue info, individual stats, local information (stats about the previous 5 to 10 games)
Recommended basketball from previous 10 years
	I'd push to 2000, personally - players back then are similar to today's players
